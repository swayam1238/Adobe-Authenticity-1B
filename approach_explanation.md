Approach for Persona-Driven Document Intelligence
Our solution tackles the challenge of extracting persona-relevant information from documents by combining efficient text extraction with semantic understanding powered by a lightweight sentence transformer model.

Methodology
Text Extraction: We use the PyMuPDF library to quickly and accurately extract raw text from each PDF document. The text is segmented into paragraphs, which serve as the basic units for our analysis. This approach is fast and has a low memory footprint.

Semantic Representation: The core of our solution is the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer model. This model is chosen for its excellent balance of performance and size (under 100MB), making it ideal for the CPU-only, offline environment. It converts both the persona description (role + job-to-be-done) and each text paragraph into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning.

Relevance Scoring: To find the most relevant sections, we calculate the cosine similarity between the persona's vector and the vector of each paragraph. A higher cosine similarity score indicates a stronger semantic match between the persona's needs and the content of the paragraph.

Ranking and Output: The paragraphs are ranked based on their similarity scores in descending order. The top-ranked paragraphs are then presented as the most relevant "extracted sections" and "sub-section analyses" in the final JSON output, adhering to the specified format.

This method is robust because it goes beyond simple keyword matching, allowing the system to understand the underlying context and meaning of the text, leading to more accurate and relevant results.
